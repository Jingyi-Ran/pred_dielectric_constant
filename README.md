# pred_dielectric_constant
Just did an easy and quick #machinelearning prediction of the average eigenvalues of electronic contribution to the dielectric tensor of dielectric materials using the dataset from matminer -- https://lnkd.in/eAidR25S

The linear regression model result was so bizarre I almost thought there was something wrong with the dataset. The random forest model however, made much more sense. The most important features correlated to the output are given at the end of the report : )
